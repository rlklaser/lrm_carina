environment_type: XYThetaLattice

##Specifies which planner to use. It can either be "ARAPlanner" for ARA* or "ADPlanner" for AD*.
  
planner_type: ADPlanner
  
##The amount of time given to the planner to find a solution. If there is still time remaining 
##after the planner finds its sub-optimal initial solution (specified by "initial_epsilon"), 
##the planner will use up remaining time improving solution until it is optimal or until time 
##runs out (which ever comes first).
  
allocated_time: 15.0
  
##The value the heuristic is scaled by for the first search. This value must be greater 
##or equal to 1. The larger this value is the faster the search tends to find a solution 
##(likely sub-optimal if epsilon is larger than 1). After the first search, the planner 
##will continue to reduce the epsilon value until it is 1 (optimal search).
  
initial_epsilon: 5.0
  
##The direction the search is done in. If you are using AD* you should use backward search 
##for fast replanning times. For ARA* it doesn't matter too much which direction you use.
  
forward_search: false
  
##The parameter only matters if you are using AD*. If at least this many map cells have changed 
##since the last plan was generated, the planner will not reuse previous search information and 
##instead plan from scratch.

#force_scratch_limit: 500 			#default

##The linear velocity of the robot in meters/sec

#nominalvel_mpersecs: 0.4 			#default
  
##The time it takes the robot to turn 45 degrees in place in seconds.
  
#timetoturn45degsinplace_secs: 0.6 	#default
  
##The cost of an obstacle in the planner's version of the costmap. All other values in the 
##costmap are scaled accordingly. The obstacle cost is the largest in the costmap2d so by 
##setting this parameter to something below its obstacle thresh, we can get obstacle padding 
##that is less harsh and more reasonable. This will make the planner more likely to choose 
##to go through more narrow areas such as doorways.
