abstract={
This paper describes the modeling, implementation, and evaluation of RoBombeiros multirobotic 
system. The robotic task in this paper is performed over a natural disaster, simulated as a 
forest fire. The simulator supports several features to allow realistic simulation, like irregular 
terrains, natural processes (e.g. fire, wind) and physical constraint in the creation and application 
of mobile robots. The proposed system relies on two steps: (i) group formation planning and 
(ii) intelligent techniques to perform robots navigation for fire fighting. For planning, we used 
genetic algorithms to evolve positioning strategies for firefighting robots performance. For robots 
operation, physically simulated fire-fighting robots were built, and the sensory information of 
each robot (e.g. GPS, compass, sonar) was used in the input of an artificial neural network (ANN). 
The ANN controls the vehicle (robot) actuators and allows navigation with obstacle avoidance. 
Simulation results show that the ANN satisfactorily controls the mobile robots; the genetic 
algorithm adequately configures the fire fighting strategy and the proposed multi-robotic system 
can have an essential hole in the planning and execution of fire fighting in real forests.

	This paper describes a study of behavioural response in terrestrial isopod

	group had a choice of sterilised food and food pellets covered with mould.
	The other group had a choice of uncontaminated and cadmium-dosed food.
	During the behavioural test, the animals were monitored by a video camera
	and each visit to food pellets and time spent around it was counted. The
	results show that animals spent significantly less time near sterilised
	and cadmium-dosed food than with uncontaminated or mould-covered food.
	Discrimination between offered food pellets showed that avoidance behaviour
	can be used as an indicator of different food quality.

	title={Monocular Model-Based 3D Tracking of Rigid Objects: A Survey},
	abstract={Many applications require tracking of complex 3D objects. These include
		visual servoing of robotic arms on specific target objects, Augmented Reality
		systems that require real-time registration of the object to be augmented,
		and head tracking systems that sophisticated interfaces can use. Computer
		Vision offers solutions that are cheap, practical and non-invasive. This
		survey reviews the different techniques and approaches that have been developed
		by industry and research. First, important mathematical tools are introduced:
		Camera representation, robust estimation and uncertainty estimation. Then
		a comprehensive study is given of the numerous approaches developed by
		the Augmented Reality and Robotics communities, beginning with those that
		are based on point or planar fiducial marks and moving on to those that
		avoid the need to engineer the environment by relying on natural features
		such as edges, texture or interest. Recent advances that avoid manual initialization
		and failures due to fast motion are also presented. The survery concludes
		with the different possible choices that should be made when implementing
		a 3D tracking system and a discussion of the future of vision-based 3D
		tracking. Because it encompasses many computer vision techniques from low-level
		vision to 3D geometry and includes a comprehensive study of the massive
		literature on the subject, this survey should be the handbook of the student,
		the researcher, or the engineer who wants to implement a 3D tracking system.

abstract="Most research on 3-D object classification and recognition focuses on recognition of objects in 3-D scenes from a small database of known 3-D models. Such an approach does not scale well to large databases of objects and does not generalize well to unknown (but similar) object classification. This paper presents two ideas to 'address' these problems (i) class selection, i.e., grouping similar objects into classes (ii) class prototyping, i.e., exploiting common structure within classes to represent the classes. At run time matching a query against the prototypes is sufficient for classification. This approach will not only reduce the retrieval time but also will help increase the generalizing power of the classification algorithm. Objects are segmented into classes automatically using an agglomerative clustering algorithm. Prototypes from these classes are extracted using one of three class prototyping algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two steps in speeding up the classification process without sacrificing accuracy."

At the same time, some characteristics of the data collected, such as its size and level of detail, provide unique visualization challenges. Currently available software systems deliver some functionalities to support construction inspection tasks by enabling the visualization and manipulation of the data captured using these reality capture technologies.

We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction.",

	This paper studies the use of volumetric features as an alternative to popular local

	success of similar ideas in object detection on static images, we generalize the notion 
	of 2D box features to 3D spatio-temporal volumetric features. This general framework 
	enables us to do real-time video analysis. We construct a real-time event detector for 
	each action of interest by learning a cascade of filters based on volumetric features 
	that efficiently scans video sequences in space and time. This event detector recognizes 
	actions that are traditionally problematic for interest point methods -- such as smooth 
	motions where insufficient space-time interest points are available. Our experiments 
	demonstrate that the technique accurately detects actions on real-world sequences and 
	is robust to changes in viewpoint, scale and action speed. We also adapt our technique 
	to the related task of human action classification and confirm that it achieves performance 
	comparable to a current interest point based human activity recognizer on a standard 
	database of human activities.

	is given in the beginning. A theoretical framework is established, supported by comprehensive

	Test results using real data are described. Both accuracy and speed are reported. The experimental

                  setups often consist of multiple cameras which have
                  to be calibrated. We present a convenient method for
                  doing this. The minimum is three cameras, but there
                  is no upper limit. The method is fully automatic and
                  a freely moving bright spot is the only calibration
                  object. A set of virtual 3D points is made by waving
                  the bright spot through the working volume. Its
                  projections are found with sub-pixel precision and
                  verified by a robust RANSAC analysis. The cameras do
                  not have to see all points, only reasonable overlap
                  between camera subgroups is necessary. Projective
                  structures are computed via rank-4 factorization and
                  the Euclidean stratification is done by imposing
                  geometric constraints. This linear estimate
                  initializes a post-processing computation of
                  non-linear distortion which is also fully
                  automatic. We suggest a trick on how to use a very
                  ordinary laser pointer as the calibration object. We
                  show that it is possible to calibrate an immersive

	The recovery of three-dimensional information from a set 
	of two-dimensional images requires the use of an accurate, 
	and fast calibration technique. Although diverse techniques 
	have been developed for single and multiple camera configurations, 
	selection of the most appropriate task-specific technique is a 
	non-trivial exercise. Therefore, in this pa per, we present a 
	review of calibration techniques, their respective application 
	domains and associated boundary con ditions. Boundary conditions 
	of particular importance in clude, desired capture volume, 
	available time budget, re quired accuracy, number of cameras and 
	type of feature de tection. Commonly used calibration tools are 
	discussed, including their specific features and target applications. 
	A methodology to determine the suitability of a calibration tool 
	for a specific setup and requirements using a syntheti cally 
	generated environment, is presented. Finally, a multi camera 
	calibration tool is evaluated for its robustness in de termining 
	important calibration information under a num ber of envisioned 
	camera configurations. The goal of this study is to aid the reader 
	in the selection of the most suit able calibration techniques and 
	tools appropriate for the task at hand.

	abstract = {We have developed and evaluated a new optical motion capture approach that is suitable for a wide range of studies in neuroethology and motor control. Based on the stochastic search algorithm of Simulated Annealing (SA),it utilizes a kinematic body model that includes joint angle constraints to reconstruct posture from an arbitrary number of views. Rather than tracking marker trajectories in time, the algorithm minimizes an error function that compares predicted model projections to the recorded views. Thus, each video-frame is analyzed independently from other frames, enabling the system to recover from incorrectly analyzed postures. The system works with standard computer and video equipment. Its accuracy is evaluated using videos of animated locust leg movements, recorded by two orthogonal views. The resulting joint angle RMS errors range between 0.7° and 4.9°, limited by the pixel resolution of the digital video. 3D-movement reconstruction is possible even from a single view. In a real experimental application, stick insect walking sequences are analyzed with leg joint angle deviations between 0.5° and 3.0°. This robust and accurate performance is reached in spite of marker fusions and occlusions, simply by exploiting the natural contraints imposed by a kinematic chain and a known experimental setup.},
